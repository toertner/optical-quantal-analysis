# optical-quantal-analysis
Matlab functions to analyze iGluSnFR signals from single synapses

These matlab files were used to perform a quantal analyis on iGluSnFR data from Schaffer collateral boutons (DÃ¼rst et al., 2020).

Instructions for use 
_________________________

BinoFit_LowHighCa(mydata, experiment) is designed to analyze data from boutons imaged under 2 conditions (high/low Ca2+).

mydata is a matlab array, organized in 4 colums per bouton: 
1) low Ca responses 2) no stim 3) high Ca responses 4) no stim

'responses' refer to the extracted peak of the iGluSnFR trace, 'no stim' is the amplitude of a fit to a section of the baseline fluorescence (before stimulation)

The 'experiment' variable allows loading data from individual boutons in large datasets containting datat from multiple boutons (in separate columns).
experiment=1 analyzes the first 4 columns (data from bouton #1)
experiment=2 analyzes column 5-8 (data from bouton #2), etc.
